# This README.md was more of a todo.txt sort of file

idea: multiplayer minesweeper

modes: singleplayer; co-op; versus; battle-royale; same modes but in lan(INCLUDING BATTLE ROYALE BECAUSE I KNOW PEOPLE MIGHT USE RADMIN OR SOME SHIT TO PLAY WITH THEIR FRIENDS)

MULTIPLAYER MODES: the server knows all the tiles but the client dont!

co-op: 2 or more people sharing the same game
versus: 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, 5v5, 6v6, 1v100, 5v69, 69v420, team1 is co-op and team2 is co-op too, but each team have their own game data(but same seed)
batte-royale: alot of players, maybe do it like tetris?? or just the people that finishes first win? have more rounds like 2-3 and some shit??? THINK MORE ABOUT IT!!!

MECHANICS:
if you lose, you can press escape key to skip the death scene

#TODO: all the keys function explanation, lol :(

#TODO: explain custom folder, radio folder, difficulties, etc
