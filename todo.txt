- create a voting system

- servers can have their own difficulties and map structures, they must send to each client when they join to download those informations

-- SERVER SIDE

- create a way to send big amount of datas without losing anything

- TCP colored + emojis chat system

- map array

KEYBINDS:
save - server config must allow or else it will warn that the user can't save the game(it also needs to be at the end), cfg must allow to save midgame if the client wants to do so

restart - create a voting system(create keybinds to press yes/no and also make it functional with mouse)
press
toggle flag

-- CLIENT SIDE

KEYBINDS:
toggle settings_menu
toggle multiplayer_menu
toggle radio_menu
toggle loadgame_menu - will kick the player out if he loads(it will warn the player)
toggle changedifficulty_menu - will kick the player out if he changes(it will warn the player)

#########################

- separate singleplayer modes from multiplayer modes

- MULTIPLAYER
- - everyone see eachother cursors
- - placeholders for eachother usernames
- - a scoreboard about who flagged more(at the end it reveals which one had the most correct flags)
- - add a time option for the server(if the time goes out, they lose)

- because the game is made mostly for singleplayer,
most of the stuff will be client-side. The server
will send when a tile is pressed, and will always
send players cursors position, it will also send
the needed stuff to load the map, unfortunately,
it will be easy to cheat because the client will
have all the information of the map, but it's
ok because it is intended to play with friends.

- IMPLEMENT THE MULTIPLAYER MODE!!!!
- - see each other cursors (maybe with different colors)(WITH A LITTLE PLACEHOLDER WITH THEIR USERNAMES(and also with char length limit))
- - future: create an UI for multiplayer: name input, color picker with a box representing the color, connect form: ip:port(address) input, password(not required), connect button

- FIND CASUAL BACKGROUND MUSICS FOR THE THEME!
- background image is strange... maybe i should remove it

### AT THE END ###
- GITHUB PAGE (already exists, UPDATE IT)!
- - CREATE THE DOCS
- - GAME UPDATER (use github to check if the version the client is using is the same as the lastest)
- - IF IT APPEARS PUBLIC: delete this repo and create another one(hide friends for their own privacy)

- remember to update README.md

- put an icon related to minesweeper and myself(SuadoSweeper)

# FUTURE
- map creator(another program -> the output is a pickle file with a map array in it)
- maps can have random flags(servers can create their own map flag handling system, with a little of programming)

- create a good tutorial, with bubble messages and tf2 soldier; sfx when the bubble changes, and also a mini "jump" animation with the bubble and the soldier
