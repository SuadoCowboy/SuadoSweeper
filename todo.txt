!! BEFORE IMPLEMENTING MULTIPLAYER YOU NEED TO SEE WHAT WILL BE SERVER-SIDE AND CLIENT-SIDE AND HOW WILL SINGLEPLAYER WORK
- SEARCH ABOUT PORT FORWARDING

- SINGLEPLAYER
- - the game the way it is right now

- MULTIPLAYER
- - everyone see their cursors
- - a placeholder for their username
- - a scoreboard about who flagged more(at the end it reveals which one had the most correct flags)
- - add a time mode

- IMPLEMENT THE MULTIPLAYER MODE!!!!
- - ver o mouse de cada um(talvez cores diferentes ou sla)(COM PLACEHOLDER DE NOME EM BAIXO BEM PEQUENO)

- FIND GOOD BACKGROUND MUSICS FOR THE THEME! GOOD AND CASUAL BACKGROUND MUSIC
- background is strange... maybe i should remove it

### NO FINAL ###
- GITHUB PAGE (already exists, UPDATE IT)!
- - CREATE THE DOCS
- - GAME UPDATER

- put a icon related to Minesweeper and myself(SuadoSweeper)
- put a free use license(something that allows EVERYTHING, EXCEPT cheat in multiplayer plwease(talk with someone who understand licenses))
